        <h2 id="section-name">Add video assets</h2>
        <p>Obviously your Brightcove Beacon app would not be very interesting with video content, so this is a hugely important task. Video Cloud is the tool used to upload your videos. Later in this doc you will see Video Cloud Studio is a commonly used tool when working with your Brightcove Beacon app. Remember that Video Cloud is the "truth" of Brightcove Beacon video content.</p>
        <p>The following are resources on getting you videos into Video Cloud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/basics/video-cloud-basics-uploading-videos.html">Video Cloud Basics: Uploading Videos</a> - A 1 minute 30 second video and four steps for a quick start to uploading content into Video Cloud.</li>

    <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="section-name">Create custom fields</h2>
        <p>Video Cloud permits you to use custom fields to add metadata to your videos. Once you have videos, custom fields play a large part in preparing those videos to be used in Brightcove Beacon. The custom fields you add to Video Cloud videos to work with Brightcove Beacon fall into three categories. Those categories, and a brief explanation of each, are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General</strong> - Information about the video content, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Genre</li>
                    <li>Short and long description</li>
                    <li>Production year</li>
                    <li>Cast</li>
                    <li>Writer</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rights management</strong> - Supports monetization and access restrictions. For instance, type of advertising and dates of video availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Episode data</strong> - If the video is an episode of a series, you define the series, season and episode number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <a href="/syncing-with-video-cloud/vc-custom-fields.html">Creating Video Cloud Custom Fields</a> document is solely dedicated to helping you create the required custom fields.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="section-name">Add images</h2>
        <p>Images you add in Video Cloud appear in your Brightcove Beacon apps. For instance, poster images from Video Cloud appear as shown here in your apps:</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/references/bcb-tasks-performed-in-vc/thumbnail-images.png" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>The <a href="/references/image-requirements.html">Images and Their Specifications</a> document specifies image requirements and also how to upload the images in Video Cloud Studio.</p>
