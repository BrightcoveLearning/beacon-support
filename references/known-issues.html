    <h3>Stream limitations and rapid switching between videos</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>If a viewer switches quickly between videos it is possible the error shown here may be displayed:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/references/known-issues/stream-limitations.png" alt="stream-limitations">
        </figure>
        <p>This occurs because it takes a number of seconds for the stream to be released, and if the viewer tries to watch another video before the stream is released, a stream limitation occurs and the error is displayed.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
