          <p>Videos that will be imported into Brightcove Beacon from Video Cloud must have an enriched set of metadata defined for proper use in Brightcove Beacon. In this document you will see how to create new custom fields in Studio. In
            addition,
            the needed fields for Brightcove Beacon are defined.</p>

          <p>To create custom fields, follow these steps.</p>

          <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
            <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
            <li>In the navigation header, click <strong>ADMIN</strong> and then <strong>Video Fields</strong>. Note that you must be an account administrator to access to the ADMIN menu.</li>
            <li>The Video Fields page will display your custom fields and all the standard video metadata fields, as shown in the following screenshot:

            </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Add Custom Field</strong>.

              </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Enter a <strong>Display Name</strong>. This will appear as the label for the field in the Upload and Media modules. An<strong> Internal Name</strong> will automatically be created for the field based on the display name.</p>
              <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: The display names to use for successful importation into Brightcove Beacon are all specified later in this document.</aside>
            </li>
            <li>Select a <strong>Type</strong> for the field.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>String</strong> - The user can type anything into the field up to 1024 single-byte characters (or 512 double-byte characters).</li>
                <li><strong>List</strong> - The user will select from a list of values. Lists can have no more than 150 possible values and each value in the list can be no more than 100 characters long.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enter a <strong>Description</strong>. The description field will appear as a hint in the Studio interface.</li>
            <li>If the custom field will be required, check <strong>Make this Field Required</strong>.</li>
            <li>
              <p>If your field type is <strong>List</strong>, enter a comma-separated list of values and then click <strong>Add to List</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>

              <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
                <ol>
                  <li>The values must not contain quotation marks (example: Animals,Birds,Fish).</li>
                  <li>No value can contain a comma - all commas will be treated as separators of different values.</li>
                </ol>
              </aside>

            </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save Field</strong> to save the changes. Click <strong>Save and Add Another</strong> to save the field and begin creating another field.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Custom fields you create are available immediately&nbsp;and will be visible&nbsp;in the Media module.</p>

          <p>Up to 10 custom fields can be created. If you need more than 10 fields, click the <strong>Need more fields?</strong> link in the Video Fields page to contact Brightcove Customer Support with a request for more. Publishers are limited to
            50 custom fields.</p>

          <h3 id="edit">Editing list values</h3>

          <p>You can add additional values to a List type custom field. Click the custom field name link, add the values and then click <strong>Add to List</strong>. When done, click <strong>Save Field</strong>.</p>

          <h3 id="delete">Deleting list values</h3>

          <p>You can add remove existing values from a List type custom field. Click the custom field name link, click the delete icon (<img alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node1050-delete-icon.png" />) associated with the value and then
            click
            <strong>Save Field</strong>.</p>

          <p>When a list value is removed, any videos that were previously assigned that value will keep the value. However, if a video with the deleted value is edited, the value will be cleared and a new value will have to be selected.</p>
          <h3 id="remove">Removing custom fields from an account</h3>

          <p>In order to remove a custom field from your account, you must <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact/create">contact Brightcove Support</a>. Note that if you have Brightcove Support delete custom fields, the modified date
            will
            change for any videos where a value was present.</p>

          <h2 id="Using_list_values_for_Brightcove_Beacon_metadata">Using list values for Brightcove Beacon metadata</h2>
          <p>In the table below you find a number of customer fields you must create. As shown above, when creating a custom field you choose the data type to be either <strong>String</strong> or <strong>List</strong>. It may ease the burden on
            video
            content curators if they can select from a list rather than having to enter a string. Also, it will invariably help to keep data entry more consistent if values can be selected from a list rather than typed in.</p>
          <p>Of course, the choice is yours, but you may find for some customer fields a list is a good selection for the data type. For instance, you may wish to consider the following, among others, for lists:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>beacon.genre</li>
            <li>beacon.ageRating</li>
            <li>beacon.viewerScore</li>
