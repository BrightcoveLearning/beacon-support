        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Undoubtedly you will want to know what viewers are watching in your Brightcove Beacon apps. To accomplish this you will use Google Analytics. Brightcove will load a customized Dashboard and a customized Google Data Studio report into your Google Analytics account. Both of these tools provide great insight into how your customers are using your Brightcove Beacon apps.</p>
        <p>In addition to the customized reports, you can use the standard analytics tools in Google Analytics to view customer behavior. You can use the standard analytics data gathered by Google, and in addition Brightcove adds other entities to use, detailed later in this doc. For instance, <strong>Movies</strong> events are dispatched when a movie is played, a default Google analytics measure, and time watched is calculated, a measure added by Brightcove. Therefore, in Google Analytics you can see the "most watched" movies by both how many times viewers played the movie and total time watched. These entities added by Brightcove are used extensively in the customized reports mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

        <p>Brightcove adds functionality to the default Google measures for your analytics reports. You can use the default Google Analytics dimensions and metrics, the building blocks of analytics reports, as well as numerous dimensions and one metric added by Brightcove. Note that dimensions and metrics added by Brightcove are NOT the same for each type of Brightcove Beacon app. For instance, the iOS mobile data has 16 custom metrics added, whereas the web site app has 20 custom metrics added. You will see how to view the custom dimensions and metric in this section of the document. To see a list of the dimensions and metric you can do so in the Google Analytics UI.
