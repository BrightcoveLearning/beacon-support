        <p>Undoubtedly, when you launch your Brightcove Beacon apps you will want to know what viewers are watching. To accomplish this you will use Google Analytics. The data provided to Google Analytics is setup by Brightcove. For instance, for <strong>Movies</strong> events
            are dispatched when a movie played and when time watched can be calculated. Therefore, in Google Analytics you can see the "most watched" movies by both how many times viewers played the movie and total time watched.</p>

        <h2 id="Viewing_dimensions_and_metrics">Viewing dimensions and metrics</h2>
        <p>Brightcove configures the building blocks for your analytics reports, those being dimensions and metrics, which are needed values for your reports. Note that dimensions and metrics are NOT the same for each type of Brightcove Beacon app. For instance,
            the iOS mobile data has 16 metrics, whereas the web site app has 20 metrics. You will see how to view the dimensions and metrics in this section of the document. To see a list of the dimensions and metrics you can do so in the Google Analytics UI.
            Follow these steps:</p>
