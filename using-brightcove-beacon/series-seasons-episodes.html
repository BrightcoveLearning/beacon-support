    <p>
      When creating a series you must define the relationships between the
      series and its seasons, and the episodes in each season. A high-level view
      of the process is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>In Brightcove Beacon, create the series.</strong> This involves
        not only naming the series, but also providing information such as
        images to be used for the series in the app, dates the series can be
        viewed, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >In Brightcove Beacon, create the seasons related to the
          series.</strong
        >
        You will provide information similar to the series, with the addition of
        selecting the series to which the season belongs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >In Video Cloud Studio, you will assign the video episodes to the
          corresponding season via values supplied to custom fields.</strong
        >
        You will then ingest those videos into the Brightcove Beacon experience.
        The fields to be assigned data are:
        <ul>
          <li>beacon.episode.number</li>
          <li>beacon.episode.seasonNumber</li>
          <li>beacon.episode.serieName</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The following diagram shows the relationship between a series and its
      seasons and episodes.

      As you have seen, creating the series and associated seasons is done in

      Brightcove Beacon. If you have not created the custom fields in Video
      Cloud Studio, see the
