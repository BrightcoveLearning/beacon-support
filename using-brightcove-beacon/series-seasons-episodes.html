      When creating a series you must define the relationships between the
      series and its seasons, and the episodes in each season. A high-level view
      of the process is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In Brightcove Beacon create the series. This involves not only naming
        the series, but also providing information such as images to be used for
        the series in the app, dates the series can be viewed, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Brightcove Beacon create the seasons related to the series. You will
        provide information similar to the series, with the addition of
        selecting the series to which the season belongs.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Video Cloud Studio you will assign the actual video episodes to the
        corresponding season via values supplied to custom fields, then ingest
        those videos into the Brightcove Beacon experience. The fields to be
        assign data include:
        <ul>
          <li>beacon.episode.number</li>
          <li>beacon.episode.seasonName</li>
          <li>beacon.episode.seasonNumber</li>
          <li>beacon.episode.serieName</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The rest of this document will provide details for each of these steps.
