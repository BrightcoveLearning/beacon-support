  <h1>Including Non-Configurable Pages</h1>
  <summary>
    In this topic, you will learn how to include non-configurable pages in your
    application design. Examples of non-configurable pages are
    <strong>Search</strong>
    ,
    <strong>Settings</strong>
    ,
    <strong>Register</strong>
    , etc.

    <h2 id="Tools">Understanding non-configurable pages</h2>
    <p>
      There are some pages which you either must, should or can include that you
      cannot customize inside Brightcove Beacon. You either choose to include
      the page or not. You may have chosen a specific layout over others for
      these pages when you worked through the document
      <a href="/getting-started/creating-your-app-design-layout-options.html">
        Creating Your Application Design - Layout Options
      </a>
      . For instance, following are the three layouts from which you selected
      one for the
      <strong>Settings</strong>
      page:
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image"
        src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/settings-layouts.png"
        alt="settings-layouts"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      When you create a page that displays the settings, which is the
      <strong>Page Type</strong>
      named
      <code translate="No">custom-settings</code>
      , you see you cannot add other content to the page:
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image"
        src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/no-blocks.png"
        alt="no-blocks"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      When you create or edit a page, the
      <strong>Page Type</strong>
      selection offers the following:
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image"
        src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/page-types.png"
        alt="page-types"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The following table displays the non-configurable page types, including a
      description and its use.
    </p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>

            will change the orientation to landscape and play the video.

      Adding a non-configurable page to your app
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adding a non-configurable page to your app is rather straight forward
      since there is little configuration that needs to be done. At a high level
      the process is:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>In Brightcove Beacon create a new page.</li>
      <li>
        Add basic data, choosing the page you wish from the
        <strong>Navigation Type</strong>
        dropdown. You will NOT be allowed to add any blocks and/or layouts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide the rest of the data for the page, as shown in the
        <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/page-settings.html">
          Common Page Configuration Settings
        </a>
        document.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For instance, if you wish to add a search page to your app, you would
      create a new page, in the
      <strong>Basic Data</strong>
      form you would select
      <strong>search-</strong>
      for the
      <strong>Navigation Type</strong>
      , and then complete the rest of the basic data. That form is shown here:
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image"
        src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/basic-data-form.png"
        alt="Select search page"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>That's it, your search page will be added to your app.</p>
