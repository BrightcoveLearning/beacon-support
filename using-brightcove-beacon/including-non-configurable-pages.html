  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Tools">Understanding non-configurable pages</h2>
    <p>There are some pages which you either must, should or can include that you cannot customize inside Brightcove Beacon. You either choose to include the page or not. Some of these pages you may have chosen a specific layout over others when you <a href="/getting-started/creating-your-app-design.html">created your application design</a>. For instance, following are the three layouts from which you selected one for the settings page:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/settings-layouts.png" alt="settings-layouts">
    </figure>
    <p>When you create a page that displays the settings, which is the <strong>Page Type</strong> named <code>custom-settings</code>, you see you cannot add other content to the page:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/no-blocks.png" alt="no-blocks">
    </figure>
    <p>When you create a page, the <strong>Page Type</strong> selection offers the following:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/non-configurable/page-types.png" alt="page-types">
    </figure>
    <p>The following table displays the non-configurable page types, including a description and its use.</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>
