      Undoubtedly when you launch your Brightcove Beacon apps you will want to
      know what viewers are watching. To accomplish this you will use Google
      Analytics. The data provided to Google Analytics is setup by Brightcove.
      For instance, on <strong>Movies</strong> events are dispatched when a
      movie played and when time watched can be calculated. Therefore, in Google
      Analytics you can see the "most watched" movies by both how many times
      viewers played the movie and total time watched.
