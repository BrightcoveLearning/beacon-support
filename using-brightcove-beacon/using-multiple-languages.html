    <h2 id="Define_the_languages_for_your_apps">Define the languages for your apps</h2>
    <p>Defining the languages you wish to use in your Brightcove Beacon apps is part of the onboarding process. Past the onboarding process, if you choose to start using multiple languages, or wish to add languages, please contact your Brightcove support contact.</p>

    <h2 id="What_is_localized">What is localized?</h2>
    <p>There are two parts of the apps that are/can be localized, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The app UI itself, which is localized for you</li>
      <li>Items you create, like page names and video metadata, for which you must supply the translated terms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UI translations</h3>
    <p>Standard pages, like the <strong>Settings</strong> page is provided in the languages you specify. For instance, here is the <strong>Settings</strong> page in both English and German:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/using-multiple-languages/settings-english-german.png" alt="settings english german">
    </figure>
    <h3>Non-standard UI translations</h3>
    <p>You use Beacon Classic UI to translate non-Brightcove Beacon UI elements. For instance, the following screenshots show the UI for adding translated page names and movie information:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/using-multiple-languages/pages-languages.png" alt="page languages">
    </figure>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/using-multiple-languages/movies-languages.png" alt="movie languages">
    </figure>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="How_your_viewers_choose_a_language">How your viewers choose a language for the app</h2>
    <p>There are two ways your viewers can choose the language to use in the app. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the language in the <strong>Settings</strong> page</li>
      <li>Set the language of the browser</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Change the language in the app</h3>
    <p>Viewers can choose the language in the Brightcove Beacon app itself. The following shows the process the viewer would follow to change the app language from English to German:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/using-multiple-languages/change-lanaguage.png" alt="change lanaguage">
    </figure>

    <h3>Set the preferred language in the browser</h3>
    <p>If a viewer sets a preferred language in a browser, and that language is supported in the Brightcove Beacon app, the app will automatically use that language. The viewer would not have to set the language in the <strong>Settings</strong> standard page.</p>
    <p>Setting a preferred language in Chrome</p>
    All popular browsers have a way to set the preferred language. As an example, this is how in Chrome the setting is done in the <strong>Advanced</strong> section of the <strong>Settings</strong> option:
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/using-multiple-languages/browser-choose-language.png" alt="browser choose language">
    </figure>

  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="How_your_viewers_select_a_video_asset_language">How your viewers select a video asset language</h2>
    <p>As in most OTT solutions, if the video asset has multiple language available, the viewer selects the desired language during video playback. A gear icon is available during playback, and clicking that icon displays a dialog and the viewer can choose the language, as shown here:</p>
