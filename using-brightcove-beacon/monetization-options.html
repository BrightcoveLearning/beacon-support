          <td>AVOD</td>
          <td>Visitors can view content containing ads in this plan without authentication. Generally free to consumers since advertisements are shown.

        <tr>
          <td>AuthVOD without ads</td>
          <td>Authenticated users can view ad-free content in this plan by signing in.<br/><br/>
          This model often requires users to log in using credentials from another platform, service, cable (TVE), or cellular subscription in order to access content. For this reason, AuthVOD is valuable when coordinating with partnerships or managing multiple properties or branded services. 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>AuthVOD with ads</td>
          <td>Authenticated users can view content containing ads in this plan by signing in.<br/><br/>
          AuthVOD can also refer to a free, ad-supported service that requires a viewer to create a login to view. The benefit to the end viewer is the ability to do things like make “watchlists” of content and “pause and resume” across devices. The benefit to the service provider is the ability to know more about the end viewer for marketing and advertising purposes.<br/><br/>
          Another benefit for users, depending on their plan settings, might be access to more content and different ad loads.

          <td>Subscribers can view ad-free content in this plan. Similar to traditional TV packages, it allows users to consume as much content as they desire at a flat rate per month.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
