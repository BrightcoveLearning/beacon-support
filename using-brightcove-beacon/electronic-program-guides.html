      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        An Electronic Program Guide (EPG) is a set of metadata linked to a video for a time-lapse with the objective of list current and scheduled programs that are or will be available on each Brightcove Beacon channel.
      </p>
      <p>This document will teach you how to structure your XML file and upload it as an Electronic Program Guide (EPG)  to Brightcove Beacon. </p>
      <p>A high-level view of the process is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an XML file with your video metadata.</li>
      <li>Drop the XML files in the Brightcove Beacon S3 bucket.</li>
      <li>
        After the steps above are completed, the file will automatically be ingested into Brightcove Beacon, and the information will be displayed in the Channels section of the platform and the Brightcove Beacon App.  
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The rest of this document will provide details for each of the steps above.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>An XML file with the video metadata. This file can be created manually or automatically via a Cron job.</li>
              <li>
                The customer must provide an RSA public key to Brightcove. </li>
                  <li>
                    An S3 account (bucket name & URL path) provided by Brightcove.

        <h2 id="generating_rsa-public-key">Generating the RSA public key</h2>
        <p>The RSA public key is an authentication credential just like a password and is widely used for secure data transmission.</p>
        <p>For EPG able to be set, the first step is to generate an RSA public key and send it to your Brightcove representative. 
        Generating an <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/" target="_blank">RSA public key</a> can be done in different ways, please contact your technical staff for more information on the best way to do it.</p>
        <p>Once you created and sent the RSA public key to your Brightcove representative, Brightcove will be able to provide you with the S3 bucket URL to drop your XML files.</p>

    <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="xml_structure">XML File Structure</h2>
        <p>To generate an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) for Brightcove Beacon, you will need to create and upload an XML file to the S3 bucket with all the metadata information of your channels as video titles, descriptions, and duration. </p>
        <p>XML Structure Example:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers"> 
            <code class="language-xml">
                
                <ChannelsList>
                < channel id="your-video-id">
                < program id="3394" time="2020-04-22T01:25:00Z" duration="PT01H45M" 
                delete="false" pvrEnabled="false" stovEnabled="false" catchUpEnabled="false">
                < title>Video Title< /title>
                < description>
                <![CDATA[
                Description of your video asset.
