    <h2 id="Tools">Introducing the Tools</h2>
    <p>
      In Brightcove Beacon the <strong>wrench</strong> icon (labeled 1)
      represents a set of tools. The options for the tools are
      <strong>Ingestion</strong> and <strong>Cache</strong> (2). This document
      explores the two options.

    <h2 id="Ingestion">Ingestion</h2>
    <p>In the Ingestion group you have three tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Update Brightcove Videos</strong>: If you have added videos to
        your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing videos, this button syncs
        the newly added or updated videos to Brightcove Beacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Update Brightcove Playlists</strong>: If you have added
        playlists to your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing playlists,
        this button syncs the newly added or updated playlists to Brightcove
        Beacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>XML EPG - Fetch XML from Folder</strong>: When your EPG
        (Electronic Programming Guide) needs to be updated, this button
        retrieves the updated XML file via FTP. The path to the XML file is set
        during the onboarding process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">
      You can also work with Brightcove support personnel to create a schedule
      to automatically perform ingestion.

    <h3>Caveats for ingestion</h3>
    <p>
      Note that not all data that is entered about a particular video in Studio
      is automatically ingested into Beacon. For instance, the following are not
      ingested into Beacon from Video Cloud:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability dates and times</strong>: Scheduling information
        set in the <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are
        not ingested into Brightcove Beacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Geo Filtering</strong>: Geo filtering information set in the
        <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are not ingested
        into Brightcove Beacon.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">
      The issues listed above can be remedied by creating a
      <strong>Package</strong> in Brightcove Beacon the assigning the video to
      that package at ingestion via custom fields. See the
      <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/create-subscription-package.html"
        >Creating a Subscription Package
      </a>
      and
      <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/use-subscription-package.html"
        >Using a Subscription Package
      </a>
      documents for further information.
    </aside>
    <p>
      Also note that not every field mentioned in Brightcove Beacon has an
      associated custom field. For instance
      <em>Production Country</em> and <em>Sub-Genre</em> do not have
      corresponding custom fields associated with them.

    <h2 id="Cache">Cache</h2>
    <p>In the Cache group you have two tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cache Purge</strong>: When you make changes in Brightcove
        Beacon, click this button to roll those changes into the current
        configuration. This option pulls all changes EXCEPT images into the
        current configuration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Image Cache</strong>: If you update any images in Brightcove
        Beacon, click this button to roll the image changes into the current
        configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>
