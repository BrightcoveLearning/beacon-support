    In this topic, you will answer a series of questions, recording answers in
    spreadsheet, that will help you determine which videos are displayed in your
    app, how they are grouped and the order in which the videos are displayed.

      This document will lead you through a series of questions about what
      videos should appear, and how those videos are organized, in your
      Brightcove Beacon Experience. The result of answering these questions will
      help you build your application design for the Brightcove Beacon
      Experience. A very simple example of what you want to have defined for
      your app is pictured here:

      You may not have experience in designing a UX for an OTT app. In the last
      section of this doc,
      <a href="Is_there_guidance">Is there guidance?</a>
      , a list of vendors' advice is shown. You may wish to read and consider
      their guidance before designing your UI.

    <p>
      You will record your decisions as you work through this document in a
      spreadsheet. To prepare the spreadsheet follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        Download a template by clicking on this link:
        <a
          href="https://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/bcbeacon/app-design-info-architecture.xlsx"
        >
          app-design-info-architecture.xlsx
        </a>
        . Be sure to remember where it is saved.
      </li>
      <li>Open a blank spreadsheet from the Google Sheets app.</li>
      <li>
        From the Google Sheets menu select
        <strong>File > Import</strong>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        From the dialog that appears, first choose
        <strong>Upload</strong>
        then click the
        <strong>Select a file from your device</strong>
        button, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        Find the Excel file just downloaded, select it, then click
        <strong>Open</strong>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        From the

    <p>
      In the spreadsheet you will record the answers to the questions in this
      document.
    </p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="What_are_logical_categories_for_your_media_assets">
      What are logical categories for your videos?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For an effective presentation of your video assets you need to consider
      logical categories for those assets. The driving force behind the
      categories should be if your customers can find the videos they want
      logically and quickly.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of categories</h3>
    <p>You have two types of categories to choose from, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Manually Built: These are categories that you choose and to which videos
        are assigned via Video Cloud Studio playlists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brightcove Beacon Automated: These are categories that Brightcove Beacon
        automatically creates. The three are:
        <em>Recently Watched</em>
        ,
        <em>Most Watched</em>
        and
        <em>Favorites</em>
        . Further details are provided in the next section of this document.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>
      Some examples are shown here to help focus on what it means to choose
      categories.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example from Above</strong></p>
    <p>In the example above you see the categories are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel Channel</li>
      <li>The Cooking Channel</li>
      <li>Recommended for You</li>
      <li>Brightcove Library</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">
      The categories will always appear in uppercase in the actual UI.
    </aside>

    <p><strong>Movie Categories</strong></p>
    <p>
      Below are some of the categories, or genres, for movies taken from
      Wikipedia:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Action</li>
      <li>Adventure</li>
      <li>Comedy</li>
      <li>Crime</li>
      <li>Drama</li>
      <li>Fantasy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It may be genres work well as categories for your customers as categories.
      On the other hand, perhaps your customers have special interests, and the
      following would be more appropriate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Animated</li>
      <li>Film Noir</li>
      <li>Documentary</li>
      <li>Cult Classics</li>
      <li>Silent Films</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>College Athletics</strong></p>
    <p>
      It might be that the large quantity of categories at the top level. For
      instance, there are 347 Division 1 (generally large) schools. You could
      have the home screen of your app list all 347 schools, but some customers
      would most likely find that long list too scroll through a poor user
      experience. You can use sub-categories, or even sub-categories of
      sub-categories to make the search for a particular set of videos easier.
      The following displays a partial structure of possible categories for a
      college athletics site. Here the structure follows the
      <em>Conference -> School -> Sport</em>
      organizational structure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Southeastern Conference
        <ul>
          <li>
            Florida
            <ul>
              <li>Football</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Volleyball</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Georgia
            <ul>
              <li>Football</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Volleyball</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pac-12 Conference
        <ul>
          <li>
            Arizona
            <ul>
              <li>Football</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Volleyball</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Oregon
            <ul>
              <li>Football</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Volleyball</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you believe the sport, rather than the conference, is most important to
      your customers you would maybe change the categorization to follow the
      <em>Sport -> Conference -> School</em>
      organizational structure.
    </p>
    <h3>Your Categories</h3>
    <p>
      From the examples you can see deciding on your categories and organization
      structure might be a straightforward, or very complex, task. You need to
      consider both your content, as well as your customers, for optimal design.
      It is imperative that you take time to think through your organizational
      structure and categories for your videos.
    </p>
    <h3>Record your categories</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have determined your categories, you will enter them into the
      spreadsheet. Enter them IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WANT THEM TO APPEAR in
      the app. In the spreadsheet, enter your ordered categories starting in
      cell B1, then B2, etc. A simple example appears as:
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image"
        src="/assets/images/getting-started/creating-app-design/spreadsheet-categories-entered.png"
        alt=""
      />
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="What_Brightcove_Beacon_built_categories_do_you_want">
      What Brightcove Beacon built categories do you want?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brightcove Beacon can provide three categories you can choose to include
      or not. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recently Watch - The top 20 videos with the most recent bookmarks</li>
      <li>
        Most Watched - The top 20 based videos based on number of bookmarks
      </li>
      <li>
        Favorites - This category is dynamically built as customers mark video
        assets as a favorite
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now add your desired Brightcove Beacon to your categories list, in the
      position you desire them. Note that you may have to use the menu commands
      <strong>Insert > Row above</strong>
      and/or
      <strong>Insert > Row below</strong>
      to make room for your additions. The altered example could appear as:

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Do_you_want_to_feature_a_video_or_videos">
      Do you want to feature a video or videos?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can feature a video or a set of videos. The featured video(s) appear
      at the top of your app and the thumbnail for the video(s) is larger. Here
      you see an app with a set of six videos featured (you can tell the number
      of videos by the dots below the carousel):
    </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img

        alt="featured videos"
      />
    </figure>
    <p>
      In the spreadsheet, locate the
      <strong>What do you want featured, if anything?</strong>
      cell. In the cell to the right of that question detail what you would like
      featured, if anything.
    </p>

      You've completed this task. Be sure to save the spreadsheet you have been
      working on for later submission to Brightcove personnel when your
      Brightcove Beacon Experience is built.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have not done so, you need to complete the other part of defining
      your application design by working through the
