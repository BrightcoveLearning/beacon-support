    <p>A <strong>series</strong> is a collection of related videos shown in a particular order, that usually share a common theme. When creating a series, you must define the relationships between the
      series, its seasons, and the associated episodes.</p>
    <p>A <strong>season</strong> is a group of videos that cover a set period of time. Each series can have one or more seasons.</p>
    <p>An <strong>episode</strong> is an individual video. You can think of this as a specific movie.</p>
    <p>Once you have defined your series and seasons, and ingested your episodes, they can be used in a Brightcove Beacon app.</p>
