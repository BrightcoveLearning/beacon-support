    <p>The Beacon Web Store is a configuration, features and API integration that enables Beacon licensees to implement subscriptions, renting and selling of Beacon videos (TVOD) in Bring Your Own (BYO) web stores. The content owners implement the store front and business logic for renting and selling and the payment system integration in the web store. An Beacon API provides the interface for the store to add, remove and edit the resulting entitlement changes within the Beacon CMS. The logic defining access and display of the content titles in Beacon apps is unchanged.</p>
    <p>Implementation of all financial reporting, dashboards, and tax payment are not managed or tracked in Beacon and are the responsibility of the Content Owner. </p>
