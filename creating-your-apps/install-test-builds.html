    <p>
      In Roku the test build is referred to as a
      <strong>non-certified channel</strong>. To set up a non-certified channel
      you must have your <strong>Vanity Access Code</strong> which is noted in
      step 9 in the <strong>Channel properties</strong> of the
      <a href="/creating-your-apps/submitting-to-roku.html#Channel_properties"
        >Submitting Apps to the Roku Store
      </a>
      document.
    </p>
    <p>An overview of the process is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a channel that is published as a developer SDK, non-certified
        channel.
      </li>
      <li>Configure the channel's properties.</li>
      <li>Provide the channel store info.</li>
      <li>
        Set the monetization option to
        <strong
          >None of the above apply. I will not be monetizing my channel.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>Upload the package.</li>
      <li>Preview and publish the channel.</li>
    </ul>
