      At some point in the development of your apps from the Brightcove Beacon
      Experience you will be given test builds to be sure the apps are behaving
      as you wish. (This is sometimes referred to as User Acceptance Testing
      [UAT].) This document will provide information on each of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Considerations</em>: Defines broad areas for testing.</li>
      <li>
        <em>Tips</em>: Suggestions and insights to follow when performing the
        testing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Reporting</em>: The procedure to following if you encounter issues
        in your testing.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Brightcove recommends the following areas be tested and questions
      answered:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Design and Features:
        <ul>
          <li>Does the experience match the agreed mock-ups?</li>

          <li>Are Ads appearing as expected?</li>
          <li>
            Are subscriptions showing for correspondent assets?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can the users purchase and get entitled to content as expected?
          </li>
        </ul>

    <p>Please consider the following tips when performing your validation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>First pass</strong>: Choose ONE of the platforms and go through
        the different areas of testing on that platform starting with Design and
        Features, then moving on to Page Layout and Content and lastly to
        Monetization testing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional rounds of testing</strong>: As you finish the first
        pass for each area, move on to other platforms that are available. If an
        issue is applicable to multiple platforms, please note that in any
        previously reported tickets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing fixes</strong>: Fixes for any of the reported issues
        could be in one of three areas:
        <ul>
          <li>The Brightcove Beacon Experience (no app updates needed)</li>
          <li>In the app(s)</li>
          <li>The Brightcove Beacon backend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the fix is in the app, a new build will be provided with details of
          what was fixed. For other areas, Brightcove would provide details in
          the ticket on what was fixed. To speed up fixing and retesting, it is
          very important that the tickets provide details on the issue and steps
          to help with retesting.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Brightcove recommends that you report issues as you encounter them to keep
      the feedback flowing to Brightcove and have the issues fixed and turned
      around for validation as quickly as possible. Please report one
      issue/ticket per problem and provide the following information in each
      issue/ticket:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform tested</li>
      <li>The app version in which the issue was found</li>
      <li>Steps to reproduce</li>
      <li>
        Please also consider including pictures or screen movies to help speed
        up identifying the problem and getting a resolution
